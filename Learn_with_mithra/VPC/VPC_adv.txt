In this we cover, 
- NACL
- VPC Endpoint
- VPC Peering
- prefixed list -> we can create a list with different ip address(customer IP) (ASOS scenario)
so we don't need to enter the IP address in the secuirty Group instead it is enough to attach this prefixed list name. 

VPC Endpoints:  It is used to make resource communicate with each other with out internet
 - two types -> 
    1) Interface endpoint(uses ENI- elastic network Interface(Card)) All AWS services. and a Private IP address will be attached to the resource.
    2) Gateway Endpoint(Doen't uses ENI, it commuicate within the region) supports S3 and DynamoDB.

    If you want make EC2 to communicate with S3 without internet then we can need to use Gateway Endpoint. 
    and both should be in the same region.

    If you want make EC2 to communicate with S3 in different region we can use Interface Endpoint. 


VPC Peering: 
- To connect two VPC without internet. 
- CIDR range should not overlap, because it they have same CIDR range as 10.0.0.0/16 they are chance the EC@ instance in the VPC have same IP address. 
- Disadvantage is it can only two vpc with one peering.  

Transit Gateway:  This overcomes the Disadvantage we saw in VPC peering.

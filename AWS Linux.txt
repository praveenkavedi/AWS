AWS Linux important commands, 

Filesystems:
1)df -h to check the size of c drive or E drive in windows 
2)du -sh * troubleshoot command -> lets say you found a filesystem which is just 10% size left, 
    now you want to check which folder or file consumed more space then us  
3) lets say there are 100 files in that folder.  now we need to sort the file in the reverse order where the file with maximum size displayed first
    du -sh * | sort -nr
            | sort by number(n) in reverse order(r)

What is CIDR? Classless Interdomain Range

Lets say I'm goin to run a busniness and I purchaed 256 computers.  I need to name each computer a name(IP) only then I can connect to the computer.

I cannot tell the machine to name the computers from 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255  (0-255) => 256

But we can say like 10.0.0.0/24 -> which is nothing but 256 computers. This is called CIDR

formula:
    10.*.*.*/27 => 32-27 = 5 => 2^5 => 32 so 32 IP we get when we put /27

Difference between 2 tier and 3 tier application:
- 2 tier -> webserver/appserver + DB server
- 3 Tier -> webserver + appserver + DB server
